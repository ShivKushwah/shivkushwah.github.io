    "description": "At Meta, I'm one of the core engineers working on Anonymous Credential Service. ACS leverages blind signatures and other cryptographic primitivies to enable de-identified authentication at scale, serving hundreds of thousands of requests per second. One of the coolest experiences I had at Meta was that I co-presented ACS at the <a href=\"https://atscaleconference.com/videos/acs-de-identified-authentication-at-scale-shiv-kushwah-haozhi-xiong/\" style=\"color: #0000EE\">Systems@Scale 2022 Conference</a>, and helped write about it on the <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/30/security/de-identified-authentication-at-scale/\" style=\"color: #0000EE\">Meta Engineering Blog</a>. We actually even received media coverage <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/business/meta-says-its-anonymous-credentials-service-acs-will-help-reduce-data-collection-activities/\" style=\"color: #0000EE\">link</a> and <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/04/meta-privacy-authentication/\" style=\"color: #0000EE\">link</a>)!"
